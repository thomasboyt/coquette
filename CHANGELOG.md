0.5.10 / 2016-02-04

[CHANGE] Make background color optional.  Allows use of Coquette as a (partly) transparent layer in a stack of canvases. (Thanks, cdosborn!)

[NEW] Add `setBackground()` color function.  (Thanks, cdosborn!)

[BREAKING CHANGE] Reorder main update loop sequence to:

* Update game
* Update entities
* Tell entities about collisions
* Render

Before, entities were told about collisions first.  This meant that, for example, an entity could move and be rendered in an impossible position, before collision resolution could be run.

This is probably not a breaking change, but I marked it as so just in case your game logic relies on the old behaviour.

(Thanks, cdosborn!)

[NEW] .gitignore support for vim.  (Thanks, cdosborn!)

0.5.8 / 2014-12-16

[FIX] Mouse coordinates are now correct when window is scrolled.

0.5.7 / 2014-12-15

[FIX] Mouse coordinates are now correct for a canvas that has a parent that is "position:relative".  (Thanks, cdosborn.)

0.5.5 / 2014-12-15

[NEW] Add Racecar demo.

0.5.2 / 2014-12-01

[FIX] Fix Left Right Space to destroy ALL asteroids in group when one member hit with bullet.

0.5.1 / 2014-12-01

[FIX] Typo in docs.

0.5.0 / 2014-12-01

[BREAKING CHANGE] Coquette no longer distingishes between initial collisions and sustained collisions.  `collision()` is still called for every tick that an entity intersects with another entity, but no collision type is passed.

[BREAKING CHANGE] Coquette no longer calls `"uncollision()` on entities.

0.4.5 / 2014-09-12

[FIX] Spinning shapes demo uses relative paths for script loading. (Thanks, douglascalhoun.)

[FIX] Box2D demo uses relative paths for script loading.

0.4.4 / 2014-06-26

[FIX] Remove unused callback params from `entities.create()` and `entities.destroy()`.

0.4.3 / 2014-03-07

[FIX] Draw people in correct place in simple demo.  (Thanks, tmcw.)

0.4.1 / 2014-03-01

[NEW] Demo that uses Box2D physics engine.

0.3.1 / 2014-01-04

[BREAKING CHANGE] Callback no longer called when entity created.

[BREAKING CHANGE] Callback no longer called when entity destroyed.

[NEW] c.entities.create() immediately creates and returns new entity. Does not wait for next tick.

[NEW] c.entities.destroy() immediately destroys entity. Does not wait for next tick.

0.3.0 / 2013-12-02

[BREAKING CHANGE] The `center` attribute on an entity is now used to indicate the entity's position (center). This replaces the `pos` attribute.

[BREAKING CHANGE] `c.inputter.state()` no longer supported. Replaced by `c.inputter.isDown()`.

[BREAKING CHANGE] `c.inputter.down()` is now called `c.inputter.isDown()`.

[BREAKING CHANGE] `c.inputter.pressed()` is now called `c.inputter.isPressed()`.

[BREAKING CHANGE] `c.renderer.getViewCenterPos()` is now called `c.renderer.getViewCenter()`.

[BREAKING CHANGE] `c.renderer.setViewCenterPos()` is now called `c.renderer.setViewCenter()`.

[BREAKING CHANGE] The `c.collider.POINT` bounding box is no longer supported.

[NEW] Collision detection works for rotated entities with a `c.collider.RECTANGLE` bounding boxes.  (Orientation doesn't matter for entities with a `c.collider.CIRCLE` bounding box.) Set an `angle` attribute on a rectangular entity to indicate its orientation in degrees.  It will get checked for collisions at that orientation.

[NEW] Entities that rotate get drawn at the right orientation.  Set an `angle` attribute on an entity to indicate its orientation in degrees.  Draw it upright.  The drawing will get rotated to the correct orientation.

[NEW] Input from mouse clicks and mouse moves is supported.

[NEW] Spinning shapes demo demonstrating mouse move input and collision detection for rotated entities.  Running on the Coquette homepage.

0.2.1 / 2013-11-19

[BREAKING CHANGE] Several object attributes renamed to discourage use from outside:

  * runner.runs to _runs

  * renderer.backgroundColor to _backgroundColor

  * renderer.viewCenterPos to _viewCenterPos

  * renderer.viewSize to _viewSize

  * collider.collideRecords to _collideRecords

0.2.1 / 2013-09-20

[NEW] Entities no longer need to have a `pos` and `size`. If they are missing either, they will be ignored when checking for collisions.

0.2.0 / 2013-09-14

[BREAKING CHANGE] `width` and `height` of view are no longer stored as separate attributes on `renderer` instance.  They are stored inside `renderer.viewSize`.

[NEW] Find out whether a key was pressed (up and down) with `coquette.inputter.pressed(keyCode)`.

[NEW] Move view position in around the world with `coquette.renderer.setViewCenterPos(pos)`.

[CHANGE] `coquette.inputter` function to find out whether a key is down is now called `down()`. `state()` still works.

[FIX] Nasty bug where uncollisions would sometimes not get fired when z indices were in use.
